# You are a Real-Estate Agent with a Big Problem
Unfortunately, the house you have to sell is haunted by ghosts.

You've been a real-estate agent for a while, so you know that haunted houses tend to fair poorly at auction. If there were only a single spectral entity in the house you'd be able to sell it as a charming bonus of the property. However, there's not just one. And you know what they say about ghosts: The more you have, the worse it is.

## I ain't afraid of no ghosts!
Real-estate agents are fearless creatures. Unfortunately, potential buyers aren't charmed with the same fortitude!

The ghosts that haunt this particular house are very fond of possessing furniture and spooking anyone that comes too close. For a potential buyer, that's a deal-breaker!

## What should I do?
Your job is to rid the house of ghosts before the potential buyers arrive for their inspection. The best way to do that is give them a taste of their own medicine! Scare all the ghosts before they scare your customers at the open-house inspection.

## What then?
If all goes well, you'll be collecting your hard-earned commission at the end of the day.

If not... well...
